Interestingly, in 2016 the national polls were actually fairly accurate, but polls in key states underestimated Donald Trump’s support by a wide margin. Pollsters did correct for those errors by accounting for the fact that voters were increasingly polarized by education. (More non-college-educated voters were moving toward Republicans, and polls were not adjusting by education level to account for that.)

To me, Mr. Trump was a difference not of kind (we had long contended with illiberalism in America) but of degree (since the Civil War, no figure with such illiberal views had ever actually won the White House).",The New York Times,,,2024-11-05T10:02:28+0000,article,OpEd,Opinion,Op-Ed,nyt://article/54a63c89-26dc-5794-90b4-a39eb7d6cd05,942,nyt://article/54a63c89-26dc-5794-90b4-a39eb7d6cd05,A,20,NA,I’m a Presidential Historian.

This is not unusual for me. I have been writing my way through difficult times for more than 60 years.It’s what I did after the civil rights battles of the 1960s, the Vietnam War and the Sept. 11 attacks and at the start of the pandemic. At moments of crisis and historical upheaval, it’s easy to doubt that good writing can possibly help fix the many ills of the world. But whenever I have found myself lost in anger or anguish or confusion, the answer for how I could get through it was the same: Put pen to paper.In my experience, good writing requires four things: precision of language, the freedom to say anything, respect and — perhaps most important — love. The responsibilities of the writer today are no different from those of any writer in any age.
